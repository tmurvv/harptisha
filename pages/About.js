                            <h2>About Tisha Murvihill</h2>
                            <p>“Magical,” “Superb,” “Virtuoso,” “Outstanding”; these are the words newspapers such as the Calgary
                                Herald and the Miami Herald have used to describe award-winning harpist Tisha Murvihill, Principal
                                Harpist of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra.

                                <br /><br />In addition to her duties with the CPO, Ms. Murvihill has recorded three solo harp CDs to great
                                acclaim. Her debut recording, If br /ahms Wrote for Harp, was reviewed as “…a stunning presentation of
                                the work of Johannes br /ahms...” (HarpColumn, January ‘04). Her second CD, A Quiet Afternoon:
                                Inspirational Songs for Harp, was awarded the “2009 Instrumental Album of the Year” Covenant Award by
                                the Gospel Music Association of Canada, and she is very excited about her third CD, Come Just As You
                                Are, which also received a Covenant Award nomination.

                                <br /><br />In 2005, the World Harp Congress honoured Ms. Murvihill with an invitation to Ireland to give a
                                lecture-recital featuring her performance and transcriptions of br /ahms’ music. She can often be heard
                                on radio stations all over North America including stations in Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Francisco,
                                Minneapolis, and Canada. She has been the featured soloist with numerous groups including the Calgary
                                Philharmonic Orchestra and the New World Symphony.

                                <br /><br />Prior to moving to Calgary, Ms. Murvihill spent three years with the New World Symphony in
                                Miami, Florida under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas. There, she was twice selected to represent
                                the orchestra at international fund raising events in Monte Carlo and received special mention on the
                                New World Symphony’s CD release Defining Dahl: The Music of Ingolf Dahl for a solo which the Miami
                                Herald called “sterling.”

                                <br /><br />Ms. Murvihill holds a Master’s Degree in harp performance from Indiana University where she
                                studied under Distinguished Professor Susann McDonald and won the prestigious concerto competition.
